As a PM, walk me through the process of designing an alarm clock app  

Why Microsoft, and why PM?  

Behavioral questions, and technical questions about my past projects  

I don't recall specific questions, but the pattern was to ask about a time when I had encountered problem X, and how i dealt with it. In order to prepare for the interview I tried to anticipate the various kinds of questions they would ask, and then look back over my experience to identify occasions when those kinds of challenges came up, so that I would have them at hand…  without too much digging through my memory.  

Why Microsoft, How would you deal with a difficult stakeholder, how do you tell a story  

How do you know what your customers want?  

Design a bingtube (similar to youtube) for videos streaming.  

Explain a project which you think has helped you the most?  

Describe the data flow for the Microsoft Band to the phone (and cloud)  

Describe a difficult problem that you had to resolve and what steps did you take and how was it communicated to upper management  

I have a rechargeable portable battery(the ones you use the charge your phone on the go), what would you change it or how would you redesign it.

Be prepared for any number of questions ranging from very specific to very broad. 3 questions I was asked:Take any production chain, how can you optimize the production process?Design a product to monitor the wellbeing of pets while the owner is away.You are a PM at a startup that works with big data. Now what?  

What's one positive and negative outcome that has occurred when working in a group?  

how would you handle an upset customer who is ready to move to a competitor service  

What is your favorite product and why?  

What technology stacks do you work with?  

Some behavioral questions, and a lot of product questions on Microsoft's products. You don't need to know in advance the in and outs of every Microsoft product but it helps to get a PM mindset beforehand. I prepared mostly with "Decode and Conquer: Answers to Product Management Interviews" by Lewis Lin. I found the book very helpful with lots of practice questions and template answers.  

(After explaining their system's process, end to end) How would you streamline our process in terms of automation?  

Questions were related to typical PM job, tracking features/resources, resolving conflicts, how to prioritize/cut/add features or make product decisions.  

How would you make the Amazon checkout process easier without compromising security?  

Design a file sharing system.Design a airport ticket booking system.

- tell me about a product you like, how can you improve it, why- design for me a tablet that will be at every seat in a stadium of a football game- explain the PM position to someone that doesn't get it- 3 step design problem, but basically design for me a tablet that will be used in taxi cabs. You decide the features, scenarios, and users. and then storyboard…  from there.- design a tablet thats sole purpose is to play sudoku- now tell me how you would implement the sudoku logic software in the tablet- now write out UML diagrams for the classes of the sudoku game  

Design an algorithm for looking at someone's email and returning a list of their contacts in order of how connected they are to each person in their inbox.  

NDA. Nothing Unexpected.  

Alot of technical questions and questions about projects. One problem solving question.  

No behavioral questions. Some questions about what I did in my previous internship. Design an elevator. But was given events or methods (he wasn't clear about what they were until I asked quite a few questions) that were pre-implemented.

What is its value?Why would Skype create Skype?Who are Skype’s competitors?  

Disney would like to start selling their movies on a new online portal. Design the website.  

I've been asked to not repeat the interview questions however I will say that they were designed on the spot and tailored to circumstances which we discussed. Some questions were impossible scenarios and didn't have an answer. They are looking to see how you think and your confidence in your answers. Anything on your resume is fair game so ensure you truly know what it says you do.  

Expected a different background and experience than mine  

Design questions, make sure you are able to determine requirements for a problem  

In the first 2 rounds they asked behavioral questions and design question like elevator. One was a technical round where they asked me a sorting question which I typically failed to answer.  

Questions are pretty standard  

Design a drone.  

The interviewer didn't ask anything about my resume  

What would you build if you could build anything?  

Design an House Management System  

Design an airport?  

Past experiences/projects.Design a coffee maker.  

Most the questions are non-technical design questions like "design an elevator for a high-rise building." I did get a probability question but I fumbled with the answer so it apparently wasn't too important.  

I was asked to design a network topology for a specific use case. I'm still not sure why since the role was specific to a data analytics engine - why not ask me to propose a design for some improvement to the data platform?  

How would you design a clock?  

All fairly standard product questions: What is a non-high-tech product you love? Talk about an app you really like and how you'd improve it.  

Detect square in an image.  

Implement a function that returns a boolean of whether two rectangles overlap.  

Can you think of a game?How would you code it? Describe with pseudo code.  

The technical questions were pretty standard. The design questions were interesting and challenging.  

Everything was pretty standard for a PM position. Started off with behavioral questions. Mostly asked for implementations of a specific system. They are looking for creative and detailed-oriented people.  

There was not any unexpected question all questions were pretty standard.  

Design a smart chair.  

The most unexpected questioning was from a female manager who wanted my specific experiences with sexism and misogyny in the workplace. She asked me many variations along this line of questioning.  

What is the most efficient way to add an element to a circularly indexed array.  

Design a travel-planning app.  

Marketing the app since as an Engineer I do not have a background in marketing new products  

Nothing really. Even if it comes up. Stay calm and take a moment to think about it. Always think back to the user and you'll be good.  

Data structure question on B-Trees.  

Your stack rank in record.  

Since I was interviewing for a Program Manager role, all the questions rotated around software development management (read the "Mythical Man Month" book!), explaining products that I like and don't like (why I like it, why I don't, how I would change, what is good, etc). People were very nice and the interviewing process was very pleasant.Communication and social skills are a must for PMs, so if you like to…  work alone in front of your computer, that's not for you.  

I struggle with a technical question during my first interview that asked something along the lines how would you create and implement database that deals with multiple servers?  

-Brain teasers  

General question  

There were no unexpected questions in the interview.  

"A CEO complains that the elevator in his building sucks - what would I do?" (I own the elevator company) - I couldn't talk with the CEO to find out what's wrong, everything was normal, the other people weren't complaining. I was focused more on customer interviews to find out what was wrong, in the end I had to test it. I could not figure the question myself, so the…  interviewer gave me a hint (I had to think about my phone and its parameters and why I chose it)  

Problem solving questions depending on the interviewer  

Have you ever been fired from a position?  

What is your understanding of the position and what are your expectation?  

Add two integer together and return a integer without using any arithmetic operators  

Seriously, none. The behavioral style is great, but it's also predictable.  

nothing too difficult, interview was as expected  

Not so much a difficult or unexpected question, but you may encounter an interviewer whose job it is to either make you NOT WANT the job or to trip you up so they can say "No Hire".  

I don't think any of the questions were difficult and neither were they unexpected (they were the types of question a PM candidate would be asked). Strengths and weaknesses regarding being a PM, I was pretty honest and wasn't sure if my honestly would come back to bite me later (yup, I was THAT honest about my weakness).  

Design a vending machine for an airport. What challenges or considerations are there?  

5 interviews at redmond the same day. Design questions.

Pretty easy question but it's one that you can over think by asking a lot of questions!You are going to have a showing next week for a new search program your making for enterprise businesses. Unfortunately, you have two large problems- 1) scalability 2) inputted data is getting lost in translation (u don't know where it is, but you can't view it in the end). You only can fix one…  before the showing, which one and why?  

pretty easy  

How would you design an algorithm for an elevator control system

Design a GPS for a 16 year old novice driver.I started talking about safety features and my interviewers latched on to that idea and followed through with it. I eventually came up with an idea where the parents could set controls through an online account. Then he asked me how would the GPS communicate with the online account.  

Design a mobile app that is a rubic's cube game  

Design an app that controls all the blinds in the building.  

design a movie ticket kiosk  

Name 5 things you would change about your smartphoneName 10 thingsAt what point would you have to say 'enough is enough'?  

The interviewer is a seasoned software developer. He asked me to come up with an algorithm for searching Palindrome after I told him in the very beginning that programming is not my strong suit. I am a PhD in mechanical engineering, and I have extensive communication, networking and managing skills from co-founding startup companies to project management. But he seemed less interested in these and only wanted to know how…  much I can code. In the previous interview workshop, he said Microsoft is interested in communication, customer focus, analytical skills and thinking process. And Microsoft is not looking for a specific skill such as coding. But during the interview, it is really just programming skill he is looking for. So If you are not a programmer, please don't waste your time.  

The questions were all standard nothing difficult. But they did ask what is your favorite Microsoft product and is there any improvements that you would make to the product.  

Design the dorm room of the future  

The first interviewer in Redmond asked a very ambiguous question about windows 8 apps, but was expecting a very specific answer. The other questions were design me a thermostat for a hotel chain,and design me an online music store. All in all it wasn't too bad after the first round, that may have just been a weeding round, however.  

I didn't expect to have the classic (

I was asked to whiteboard a lot. Practice at a whiteboard before hand - even if it's just diagraming the process of making cookies.  

some questions are technical and you dont expect them in the product management.  

Design a system to prevent click fraud.  

The interview had no particular tricks. It all revolved around projet management and technology.  

You are on a desert island, and all you have is a pair of dice. You know that a plane flies over the island on the 30th day of the month. Using the dice, how can you make a calendar that always tells you the day of the month?  

The elevator pitch was difficult to me since I wasn't expecting it.  

Improve Outlook. Make it novel.  

There was a question about how I would handle and solve a problem with designing an elevator system for the building, with some constraints. Nothing to do with the job... it was a fabrication of a scenario with no real correct answer, but used to check how I dealt with something unexpected as well as logical approach to problem solving.  

(in the last interview) what were you asked in all of your previous rounds. Which ones do you think you could have done better. Do you have better responses to them now.

Brain Teaser #1 -You are on a game show. Pretend I am the game show host. Now, pretend that I am showing you 3 curtains and I am also telling you that behind 2 curtains are goats and behind the remaining curtain is a car. He then draws 3 boxes on the board and labels then 1, 2, and 3. Now he tells me to pick a curtain. I pick…  curtain number 3. Now he says, "Okay.

I'll give me a chance to change your answer to curtain #2 or stick with curtain #3.What do you do and why?  

Brain Teaser #2 -Implement an algorithm in pseudo-code that outputs the angle between the hour hand and minute hand of an ordinary clock at any moment in time. (You are not allowed to hardcode anything. The algorithm must use formulas that you come up with yourself to translate the hours to degrees and the same for the minutes). For example, if the minute hand is exactly at 12, you cannot…  hardcode 12 = 0 degrees.  

Pretend you are in a factory that produces cones. There is a conveyor belt in a factory that moves these cones from 1 machine to another.
