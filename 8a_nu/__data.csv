Hi I'm Zoe. I have been climbing since the end of 2012. I started in England in a gym in Plymouth and got tonnes of flappers and new nothing about climbing. I then moved back home and climb at Pulse now in Newcastle. But I don't live in Newcastle. I started outdoor bouldering mid 2013. Maybe a bit later -- don't remember. I wish I liked trad or sport climbing because I think they look nice until I get attached to a rope. Truth is I love bouldering too much. 
I've done a few comps. And I feel like I have spent almost every weekend this year climbing boulders in Sydney that I have really got no where on.",1993-05-11,05,11,1993,165,,2012,I'm a student.,"There really is none. If I said one it would be a lie.

Sebastian Schwertner,39559,Germany,Erlangen,"started climbing in Schriesheim back in 1983. The first two years doing only easy climbs up to 6a. A lot of them on natural pro. This changed when I turned 18 and got to use my parents car for weekend trip to Pfalz, 60 kms away from my home town Heidelberg. I was still in school and spend the holidays in Southern France mainly Buoux, Verdon and the Calanques. 
After school I went climbing for 2 years, with the occasional job thrown in to raise enough money to stay on the road. Went to the US (west coast, Nevada and Texas), Wales and Australia. 1990 I moved to Frankenjura and have been living there since. In 1999 I started with a guidebook for the area. Which has been updated every other year and is selling pretty well.
I quit my job in IT in 2010 to do an iPhone APP of Kletterfuehrer Frankenjura and go on a European climbing trip. Back into IT in 2012 because I get to climb more than working on guidebook projects.",1968-03-14,03,14,1968,167,58,1983,writing the Frankenjura guidebook,,tie for 1st in Brisbane/Aus in 1990,"Frankenjura, Red River Gorge, Kalymnos",Frankenjura,8b+,,1

Hidden Peak was where I did 90% of my climbing until I moved to Boulder at age 18. I have been competing since 1998, and did my first youth nationals in Denver, CO that same year. Unfortunately, Chicago is flat, and very limited as far as training - and outdoor climbing was at LEAST a 6 hour drive away. In the past few years in Boulder I have been able to hone my skills and technique, and get stronger. Since I graduated from CU in 2010, I have had exponentially more time and freedom to go climbing anywhere I want, whenever I want.

Birte Loichen,27022,Germany,Heilbronn,"I have been climbing for more than 16years. I started out sport climbing with my parents on vacations. When I was twelve, my dad took me to several regional and national climbing competitions in Germany. I soon realized that for me, climbing was all about being outside. On rock, I climbed better and more motivated than indoors. At the age of 23, I decided to focus mainly on pushing my limits outdoors and I definitely have not reached my personal limit yet. In 2015, I climbed my first 8a “Poseidon“ (Bärenschlucht, Frankenjura). Some weeks later I could assure my strenght in “Alice Springs“ 8a (Terminal, Albenga) and “Orange amer“ 8a (Fausses fractures, Kronthal). Besides climbing, I have a full-time job managing a climbing gym. For now, there I spent most of my time - working and training. As often as possible I travel to Frankenjura, Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland and Austria for checking out different cracks and rock types.",1989-12-02,12,02,1989,174,,2001,Manager of a climbing gym,,,"Siurana, Spain / Céuse, France","Frankenjura, Nordvogesen",8a,,0

Olivia Pottymouth,52942,United States,"Knoxville, TN","Once upon a time I was a non-climber. I sat in my house, frowning, knitting socks for all my future babies, eating donuts and bacon, surrounded by dozens of cats. Suddenly the ground started shaking. Plates and cups clattered to the floor. I watched in amazement as the floor shifted, the roof caved in, and a giant boulder arose from the middle of my living room, splitting the couch in two. My knitted socks went everywhere! The cats mewed apprehensively and sniffed at the new rock that was now the centerpiece of my livingroom.

I reached out. I touched the rock. My hands caressed the perfect jugs and crimps. I pulled myself up and climbed, my heart soaring with a joy I had never known. I got to the top of the rock. I looked down. The rock began to crumble in fear at my strength. Somewhere, deep in the recesses of my soul, I knew that this was the first of many boulders I would crush with my steel fingers and sunny disposition.

My practices are Monday through Friday, 4 PM- 7 PM, and my home gym has the 10 meter IFSC speed wall, which allows me to constantly train speed. I am a very driven 15 year old girl, and I am among the top 3 best rock climbers in my age group. I always travel with my rock climbing team and we make trips to go outdoor climbing several times a year. I go to Hueco Tanks every winter break, the Red River Gorge every summer for 6 weeks, and occasionally go to Horse Pens 40. I have participate in all SCS and ABS youth competions including divisionals and nationals since 2008 and I have been a member of the USA team since 2010.

I have been climbing basically since I could walk thanks to my amazing parents who introduced me to the sport! Right now, I am focusing on bouldering and trying to make semi finals at a world cup! I love getting outside to sports climb in good company and enjoy pushing myself mentally. Some of the climbers I look up to the most are Vikki Weldon ( one of my old team mates), Knut Rokne ( my old coach) and Thomisina Pidgeon. These guys inspire me to give 110% to the sport! I also write a travel/climbing blog. I enjoy sharing my personal experiences and struggles with competitions and outdoor climbing. So if you are interested in my journey check out my blog! http://jelisad.blogspot.at/",1989-09-12,09,12,1989,,58,1999,Route setter/ Coach/ Nanny,"Playing guitar, Painting, Traveling, Dancing, Creative writing, Blogging, Photography, Wine.",1st,Where your heart tells you to go,,8a,8A,0

Natalie Hawley,32950,United States,"Chattanooga, TN","I started climbing through a weekend college course in the summer of 2002.  My climbing ""career"" began with toproping and trad climbing in the wildnerness of North Carolina, then I fell in love with sport climbing.  For a few years I enjoyed the experiences of climbing in areas across the US more than I enjoyed the physical act of climbing.  For the past three years I've focused on pushing myself in bouldering and getting beyond the mental setbacks in sport.  2009 was the first year that I actually had projects in mind in both bouldering and sport domains and I enjoy this new level of climbing.  Now that I live within a few minutes of a climbing gym it's quite difficult to train without overdoing it, but I love being that addicted to a ""hobby.""",1983-03-14,03,14,1983,150,48,2002,Miguel's pizza worker,"Drinking coffee, reading (in lieu of tv), and daydreaming about the next climbing trip.","1st overall women's advanced, Triple Cro",Red River Gorge,,7c+,7B+,0

Onsight: Problem climbed first try with no knowledge of sequences or beta through pictures, video, or personal observation of other climbers. Unlimited examination of holds including touching allowed as long as no artificial means involved such as stacked pads, ladders, boosts, etc. Repeated visits to examine the boulder are not allowed according to my standard.

Ansie Yssel,21360,Belgium,Leuven,"I started climbing because my friends were climbing and the only way I could see them over weekends was to go to the crags with them. Refusing to be nothing more than a base camp bitch/ belay bunny I bought a pair of climbing shoes in September 2007, two weeks later someone broke into my car and stole the climbing shoes and the camera I got for my birthday (bastard thief). Being a poor student with angry parents I had to spend the last of my money on a replacement camera. So I had to wait for Santa to give me Christmas money, He didn't. But that didn't stop me from going to Fernkloof with my friends and playing around in The North West University boulder cave. Then finally I bought another pair of climbing shoes at the end of December and as soon as varsity started again in February 2008 I started climbing with the NWU rock climbing club. First time sports climbing was not a pleasant experience, but bouldering on real rock for the first time at the 2008 NBL finals kicked ass! After a trip to Oudtshoorn in Dec 2008 and red-pointing Ghoonie Goo Goo I am starting to fall in love with sport climbing as well...just need to sort those fear issues out.",1982-02-04,02,04,1982,179,58,2007,Student,,,,"Fernkloof, Chosspile",,6B+,0

* = An OK problem/route.  It has at least one redeeming characteristic (i.e. it isn't ugly, it isn't totally lowball/dabby, it has fun movement).

** = A great problem/route.  Should make up the majority of my climbs.  Good looking line that isn't dabby or tweaky.  What typically holds these lines back from *** is lack of aesthetic appeal.

*** = Simply amazing.  The gems of an area that are must do's.  If you are climbing in this area, do these before anything else.  

****/'Recommended' = The best of the best.  Even non-climbers are impressed by these problems.  Intimidating, imposing, and beautiful.  Not too many of these in the world...

Jéssica Damásio (f),46831,Brazil,Taguayork City,"Muita gente me pergunta por que motivo eu escolhi um esporte que vive me deixando roxa, com mão e pés calejados, em que constantemente tenho que me locomover pro mato, às vezes tomar banho frio, comer sempre atum e etc... Realmente, eu quase não pinto mais as unhas, meu cabelo vive bagunçado, abdico muitas vezes dos shorts porque minhas pernas estão roxas e machucadas. Eu fico no mato, durmo no relento, se precisar, como o que tem e gasto meu dinheiro com equipamentos e roupas esportivas e quer saber? 
Meu esporte não é só um esporte, é um estilo de vida.
 Meu estilo de vida me faz valorizar o simples, cuidar do meu corpo, conhecer lugares e PESSOAS INCRÍVEIS.
 Meu estilo de vida me faz reparar sempre na Criação e agradecer sempre ao Criador.
 Meu estilo de vida não se importa com dinheiro, aparência ou status.
 Meu estilo de vida me ensinou e ser perseverante e nunca desistir.
 Meu estilo de vida me proporciona a paz de ouvir os passáros olhando para um céu estrelado, tomar banho de cachoeira, comer atum e ainda assim me sentir a mulher mais RICA E ABENÇOADA do mundo.

donde permitir que los anhelos vuelen para alcanzar vínculos tan personales como especiales

Michael Schreiber,53824,Germany,Berlin,"Since I started climbing in the year of 2000 in my home town Berlin on tiny artificial walls, it took 8 years to climb my first route beyond the magical climbing french grading difficulty of '8a'. With the help of my friend Thor I achieved such a route in Slovenia's Misra Pec. Without having climbed the grade 8a yet at all I tried a short and steep route called ""STRCA SCRA"" - 8a+. Surprisingly I succeeded on the nightmare date january 1st at around noon after an excessive night out and long 3 hours of sleep.
In my teenage years I participated in the national German cups & Championships finishing 3rd or 4th place. Then I was offered to start for the National German Youth Team in European and World Cups but just before the season started I had a terrible skying accident braking my clavicle, resting 6 month. Right after, I had the chance to do a high school year in Connecticut, USA and didn't get to climb for basically a year and a half.  
Coming back to Berlin, I trained again and finished 6 times Berlin Lead and 2 times Berlin Boulder champion, first in youth then adults.",1987-10-10,10,10,1987,182,73,2000,"Hotel Clerk, Photographer","party, fresh food/cooking, music (jazz, electro), traveling, animals, nature, swimming, cycling, tantra",1.

Flash: I have used every possible outlet of information for the boulder short of actually touching the rock.

Barry J. Hard-On,1353,Australia,Blackheath,"not as married as i once was,so im left to my own devises (if you know what i mean)
is there a word,an expression even an emotion to express the hollow in in my loveless heart?. my perpetualy furrowed brow ,my covolsive facial spasms and a countinence that shows eternal sorrow but portrays
little of what i have felt.
oh, my dearest beloved,love like i had for you has never been felt in the history of all things, my body aches with every heaving breath and acrid tears fall,a never ending deluge of grief burning 
trenches deep into my already disfigured pallid face.
i have tried to live a happy life without you,it is like living life without a heart or a soul and tears wash nothing away. 
eternal non-existance awaits me as it has taken you, my only eternal love.i dont regret my birth as it brought me to you,i regret
not telling you of the ardent never ending love i had for you.
my life ended when yours ended,it is only my body that must now leave this earth.where was i before i was born, years before i was conceived.i know not,only that there is not the potential for such a wretched existance after my departure .eternal rest at last.
i'll never stare into you deep brown eyes again,run my fingures through your flowing brown hair nor feel your hand on mine,no heaven ,no hell,nothing.
my love. my life,the blood that once flowed in veins,
i loved you.",1983-12-26,12,26,1983,161,53,2015,Norrys apprentice,,33st,Box Norbanger,,8c+,8B+,0
