spanishdict is missing some unconventional word conjugations e.g. verbs created from nouns

could proxy difficulty of text by average google hits per unique word but it's unscientific and ultimately unhelpful
need to extract proper nouns without definitions
will have probems with like diminutives and stuff
this IS possible but it's damn hard. assess the value and be damn sure it hasn't already been done/started, and ask for help from those who may be able to give it.

wait honestly better to go bottom-up, only keep a-z and accented

turns out spanishDict has substantially fewer words than competition, oops

spanishdict has nueva and nuevo as separate lexemes


sometimes it'll be way wrong like it defaults to english->spanish

should I start with 5000 and scrape spanishdict for variants instead?
5000 words constitute the active vocabulary of native speakers without higher education.
learning the top 3000 most frequently used words will get you to 88.2% for non-fiction, 89.6% for fiction, and 94.0% for oral speech.
those both seem really untrue as I probably know 5000

this is going to be crap due to homonyms and false not-words but in theory the EXACT order doesn't matter (bc empirical imperfection) as long as it's close


CREA is probably best existing dataset
lots of words
good source

problems:
no swearwords, presumably no slang
includes proper nouns
includes plurals, conjugations
actually TOO long to work with comfortably maybe so cap it at 50,000 words or something
currently has about 740,000 entries - the end is garbage basically
ahahha the last three entries are:
zzzzzzzzzzzzz
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
where is this from??
so yeah also contains straight up errors (zzzzzz, musica without accent mark)
probably want to filter it before you trim it because you might need the first 80,000 to end up with 50,000
psyched

simply comparing vocab size/advancedness of diffrent authors/books pre-choosing which one to read


spanish dialect quiz would be nice
vos/vosotros/consonants then tell you where you're from
neat for non-natives like I want to know what accent I have


at the end of the day what do I want?
-infinitive verbs (probably should distinguish between SE and not)
-adjectives (masculine, singular)
-nouns (masculine, singular, not proper)
-misc particles



ANOTHER APPROACH is to take an english word list and translate it
pros: better starting data
cons: potentially sketchy translations (although maybe not any worse?), missing things(?) honestly hard to say
well from comprehension POV you might grab uncommon translation option unless you cross reference this list then it's like why'd you bother? idk


aspects of fluency:
-grammar
-idioms
-speed listening
-tongue strength/accent
-vocab


is it substantially better than just finding a place to start in the list and going down 50 words a day?



backwards approach download dictionary then use this to get frequency




in order to start going through spanishdict pages we need to establish how many kinds of pages there are
this is gonna be a shitshow


what to do about homonyms
