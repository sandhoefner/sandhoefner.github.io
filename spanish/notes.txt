CREA is probably best existing dataset
lots of words
good source

problems:
no swearwords, presumably no slang
includes proper nouns
includes plurals, conjugations
actually TOO long to work with comfortably maybe so cap it at 50,000 words or something
currently has about 740,000 entries - the end is garbage basically
ahahha the last three entries are:
zzzzzzzzzzzzz  
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz   
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz     
where is this from??
so yeah also contains straight up errors (zzzzzz, musica without accent mark)
probably want to filter it before you trim it because you might need the first 80,000 to end up with 50,000
psyched


at the end of the day what do I want?
-infinitive verbs (probably should distinguish between SE and not)
-adjectives (masculine, singular)
-nouns (masculine, singular, not proper)
-misc particles


ANOTHER APPROACH is to take an english word list and translate it
pros: better starting data
cons: potentially sketchy translations (although maybe not any worse?), missing things(?) honestly hard to say
well from comprehension POV you might grab uncommon translation option unless you cross reference this list then it's like why'd you bother? idk


aspects of fluency:
-grammar
-idioms
-speed listening
-tongue strength/accent
-vocab


is it substantially better than just finding a place to start in the list and going down 50 words a day?



backwards approach download dictionary then use this to get frequency
