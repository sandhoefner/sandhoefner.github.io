one strum or lick per
E                                                A
There were moments of dreams I was offered to save
E                                               A
I live less like a workhorse, more like a slave
C#m
I thought that one quick moment that was noble or brave
		   A
Would be worth the most of my life.

E                                                A
So I pointed my fingers, and shout a few quotes I knew
E                                               A
As if something that's written should be taken as true
C#m
But every path I have taken and conclusion I drew
								A
Would put truth back under the knife.

F#m                                                 B7
And now the only piece of advice that continues to help:
C#m                           E*                             A
Is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else.

E*     A          E2
When my time comes,
A2  C#m2     B   A
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
E*     A          E2
When my times comes,
A2  C#m2     B   A
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.


E                                                A
So I took what I wanted and put it out of my reach
E                                                A
I wanted to pay for my successes with all my defeats,
C#m
And if heaven was all that was promised to me
						 A
Why don't I pray for death?


E                                                A
And now it seems like the unraveling has started too soon,
E                                                A
Now I'm sleeping in hallways and I'm drinking perfume
C#m
And I'm speaking to mirrors and I'm howling at moons
									 A
While the worst and the worst that it gets.


F#m                                                 B7
Oh you can judge all the world on the sparkle that you think it lacks.
C#m                           E*                             A
Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.

E*     A          E2
When my time comes,
A2  C#m2     B   A
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
E*     A          E2
When my times comes,
A2  C#m2     B   A
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.

C#m                           E*                             A
Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.


a capella with harmony
When my time comes,
A2  C#m2     B   A
